	<ul style='margin-top: 10px'>
    <li><strong>Application Name</strong>: [title of the website for this client registry]</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: [short description of your website]</li>
    <li><strong>Website</strong>: [your website's URL(example: http://www.domain_name.com)]</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth redirect uri</strong>: [this is the URL for WordPress' Settings page for the Easy Instagram plugin. Should look like this:
      http://www.domain_name.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=easy-instagram ]
      Then click 'Register'. You should be taken to the “Manage Clients” panel which will list:
		<ul class='manage-clients'>
            <li><strong>Client ID</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Client Secret</strong></li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>The Easy Instagram plugin is now set up and ready to use on your website!</p>
<br />

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To create one or more Instagram photo feeds, use the Easy Instagram widget, or use the following shortcodes to generate an Instagram feed in the content area of a Post or Page. By default the shortcode will display a single image.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram user_id='123456789']</li>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram tag='puppy' limit=2]</li>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram user_id='123456789' limit=4]</li>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram tag='puppy' limit=2 caption_hashtags=false]</li>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram user_id='123456789' author_format='published by %s']</li>
<li class='code'>[easy-instagram user_id='123456789' limit=4 thumb_click='thickbox']</li>
</p>

<br />
<h4>Options</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>user_id</strong> = The numerical ID number for your Instagram account shown on the Easy Instagram Settings page</li>
<li><strong>tag</strong> = hashtags to search for</li>
<li><strong>limit</strong> = amount of pictures to display (10 is max). Default: 1</li>
<li><strong>caption_hashtags</strong> = show or hide hashtags from the end of image caption. Default: true</li>
<li><strong>caption_char_limit</strong> = limit the number of characters output in caption. Set 0 for no caption output. Default: 100</li>
<li><strong>author_text</strong> = allow setting the text format for the image autor. Default: "by %s"</li>
<li><strong>thumb_click</strong> = define the action on thumbnail click. Default: no action.
	<ol>
    <li>'thickbox' -> Open the image in a Thickbox popup</li>
    <li>'original' -> Open the original image from Instagram, in a new browser tab</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>time_text</strong> = defines the output format for the image time. The value “#T#” is replaced by the time value generated by the “time_format” option.
Default: "posted #T#"
<li><strong>time_format</strong> = defines the time format. Accepts the standard PHP time formats used by “strftime” (<a href = "http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php" target="_blank">http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php</a>) or “#R#” for 'relative time'. Default: "#R#".
</ul>
</p>

<p>For multiple photo feeds each using different hashtags or user ids, repeat the shortcode with different options set, or add the widget a second time to the same widget space, and enter different settings.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>Why do I have to register for an Instagram API client with this plugin? </h4>
<p>In order to display and feed Instagram photos through a website, someone must have registered an API client with Instagram.<br/> 
<br/>
There are many other Instagram plugins that use the same API key for thousands of installations. 
Using that kind of plugin, you share the risk with all of the thousands of other plugin users that the plugin developer may disappear, may not keep the API key active, and effectively break your site feature without notice.  
You also risk the plugin developer eventually charging for their plugin, especially because they're providing an API registration service on which you've become dependent.<br/>
<br/>
The 'Easy Instagram' advantage is that only you (your website) and Instagram are involved, and that still -- you don't need to know any code whatsoever to complete the installation process.<br/>
<br/>
Basically involving a series of cuts-and-pastes, most people report having registered their API client in just a few minutes.</p>
<br/>



<h4>Can I use multiple shortcodes in the same page?</h4>

<p>Yes, but please notice that in some cases a small penalty in the page loading time can occur.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Does the displayed image author user name link to their Instagram profile page?</h4>

<p>Yes it does, as of 'Easy Instagram' release 1.2.3.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Can I disable the hashtags in the caption? </h4>

<p>Yes.  Add caption_hashtags=false to your shortcode.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Can I hide the image description, the image author, or the date posted / time since post?</h4>

<p>Yes.  Check out our new widget settings (leave fields blank to disable display), and our new shortcode options on the 'Help' tab on the plugins Settings page in your CMS.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Can I change the size of the thumbnail?</h4>

<p>We may be able to include this feature in a future version.  In the meantime, you can change the thumbnail sizes by editing the CSS:<br/>
<br/>
div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-wrapper img.easy-instagram-thumbnail{<br/>
width:200px !important;<br/>
height:auto !important;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
If you want to resize the thumbnails only for example in a sidebar you can do something like this:<br/>
<br/>
.sidebar_classname div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-wrapper img.easy-instagram-thumbnail{<br/>
width:200px !important;<br/>
height:auto !important;<br/>
}</p>
<br/>

<h4>Can I disable the hashtags in the caption?</h4>

<p>Yes.  Add <span class='code'>caption_hashtags=false</span> to your shortcode.</p>
<br/>

<h4>What is the 'Cache Expire Time' ?</h4>

<p>To speed up page loading, the images are downloaded from the Instagram server and stored to your local web server. At the interval specified by the 'Cache Expire Time', these files are deleted and read again from Instagram.
This means that when a new image is uploaded to Instagram, it will not appear on your website until the next cache expiry interval.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Is it possible to arrange the 10 images horizontally?</h4>

<p>You can solve this using CSS styles.  Each thumbnail has a div container with a CSS class on it so you can customize it the way you want.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Can I center the pictures?</h4>

<p>Yes.  Picture alignment can be customized directly in the CSS.  To center align the picture, add the following in your style.css:</br>
div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-wrapper {text-align:center;}
</br></br>

This will actually align all the content to the center.  If you want just the image to be center aligned but keep the text aligned to the left, you also need to add:</br>
div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-author, div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-caption, div.easy-instagram-thumbnail-time{text-align:left;}</p>
